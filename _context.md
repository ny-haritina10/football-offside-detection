i have an app with java swing who take as an input an image (jpeg, png, jpg, ... ) . This image is a hand-drawing (using Paint or somethign like that) of a football pitch with 2 teams (11 players each) represented by a circle . Each teams has a colors and the ball is colored in BLACK. Here is the issues, the main functionnality of the app, is to detect if there is an offside player based on the given images, the app will draw the offside line and tell which players are offside if there is any. 



The issues is that , to detect the player (which is a key point to check if there is players who is offside) i use  a simple approach with by checking each pixels, which is, a non efficient solution when i change the given images (background color, players circle forms ... ) . I want you to enhance my algorithm to detect the player on the given image using OPEN CV ... i want it to be really accurate ... How can i do that ?
